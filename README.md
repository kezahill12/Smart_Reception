**AI Hospital Smart Reception System**

---

## 📌 Overview

SmartReception is a modern hospital communication and reception management system designed to automate and improve how patients interact with healthcare facilities.

It enables hospitals to handle:

* 📞 Calls (voice-based interaction)
* 💬 SMS communication
* 📧 Email notifications
* 📅 Appointment management
* 🔔 Real-time activity tracking

The system is built as a **scalable, multi-language, and intelligent platform** that can operate both **with and without AI**.

---

# 🧩 SYSTEM STRUCTURE

---

### 🎤 Voice-to-Voice Communication

### How it works:

1. Patient speaks
2. Speech → converted to text (Speech-to-Text)
3. AI processes request
4. AI generates response
5. Text → converted to voice (Text-to-Speech)
6. Patient hears a natural response

👉 Creates a **human-like conversation experience**

---

### 💬 AI Chat (SMS / Chatbot)

* Responds to patient messages
* Handles common questions
* Guides booking process

---

### 🧠 Natural Language Understanding

The AI understands:

* “I want to see a doctor tomorrow”
* “Reschedule my appointment”
* “Cancel my booking”

---

### 💾 Conversation Storage (Behind the Scenes)

Even for voice:

* All conversations are converted to text
* Stored in database
* Linked to patient records

#### Stored Data:

* Full transcript
* Timestamps
* Detected intent
* Optional audio file

---

### 🧠 Emotional Intelligence (AI Behavior)

The AI is designed to respond **professionally and empathetically**.

#### Goals:

* Never ignore the patient
* Show understanding
* Stay calm and respectful
* Adapt to emotional tone

#### Examples:

**Frustrated patient:**

> “I understand this might be frustrating. Let me help you quickly.”

**Confused patient:**

> “No problem, I’ll guide you step by step.”

---

### 🚫 AI Safety Rules

The AI must:

* Not give harmful medical advice
* Escalate complex cases to humans
* Keep responses clear and helpful

---

### 🌍 Multi-Language Support

* 🇷🇼 Kinyarwanda
* 🇫🇷 French
* 🇰🇪 Kiswahili

#### Features:

* Auto language detection
* Respond in same language
* Manual language selection

# 🔄 System Flow

1. Patient calls or sends message
2. AI (or system) receives input
3. Request is processed
4. Action executed (booking, cancel, etc.)
5. Conversation stored
6. Activity logged
7. Notifications sent
8. Frontend updates instantly

---

# 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Docker Desktop** (Required for the easiest setup)
- **Java 17+** & **Node.js 20+** (Optional, for manual development)

### 2. Setting up Environment Variables
Clone the repository and create your `.env` file from the example:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Open `.env` and fill in the required values (Database credentials, JWT secret, and OAuth IDs).

### 3. Run with Docker (Recommended)
This will start the Database, Backend (Spring Boot), Frontend (React/Vite), and Nginx Gateway:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
Once started, you can access:
- **Application (Gateway):** [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- **API Docs (Swagger):** [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

### 4. Manual Development Run
If you want to run the services separately for faster development:

**Backend:**
```bash
cd apps/backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd apps/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Database Only:**
```bash
docker compose up db -d
```
